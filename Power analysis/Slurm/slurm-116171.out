Chain 3 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 3 Exception: lkj_corr_cholesky_lpdf: Random variable[4] is 0, but must be positive! (in '/tmp/RtmpeOUyLC/model-37f96d1c6663bc.stan', line 120, column 2 to column 29)
Chain 3 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 3 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

`summarise()` has grouped output by 'nTrials', 'Alpha', 'participant_id'. You
can override using the `.groups` argument.

Chain 4 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 4 Exception: normal_lpdf: Scale parameter is 0, but must be positive! (in '/tmp/Rtmp89BSpI/model-37f2fb2e63e333.stan', line 68, column 2 to column 49)
Chain 4 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 4 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

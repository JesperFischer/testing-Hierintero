Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains...

Chain 1 Iteration:    1 / 4000 [  0%]  (Warmup) 
Chain 2 Iteration:    1 / 4000 [  0%]  (Warmup) 
Chain 3 Iteration:    1 / 4000 [  0%]  (Warmup) 
Chain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 1 Exception: normal_lpdf: Scale parameter is 0, but must be positive! (in '/tmp/RtmpkhnR6V/model-37ed0c6c43e147.stan', line 101, column 2 to column 49)
Chain 1 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 1 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

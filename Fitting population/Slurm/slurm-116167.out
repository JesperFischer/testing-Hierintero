`summarise()` has grouped output by 'nTrials', 'Alpha', 'participant_id'. You
can override using the `.groups` argument.
`summarise()` has grouped output by 's'. You can override using the `.groups`

Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains...

Chain 1 Rejecting initial value:
Chain 1   Gradient evaluated at the initial value is not finite.
Chain 1   Stan can't start sampling from this initial value.
Chain 1 Iteration:    1 / 4000 [  0%]  (Warmup) 
Chain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 1 Exception: normal_lpdf: Scale parameter is 0, but must be positive! (in '/tmp/RtmpxA9CDj/model-37f0297df8959a.stan', line 68, column 2 to column 49)
Chain 1 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 1 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
